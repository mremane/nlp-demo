> Basic pre-processor of LA Times articles

Extracts all articles from a .txt file using BeautifulSoup to parse XML-like structure and processes text using NLTK and python data structures.

Tokenizes each article, removes stop words and provides total word occurence count per word for all articles.

## Output Sample:
``` bash
Word | Count
['would'] : 19
['see'] : 11
['business'] : 11
```
